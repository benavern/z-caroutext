# z-caroutext 

Z-caroutext is a javascript plugin that lets you create a text carousel very easily.

You just need a span with the `z-caroutext` class and some parameters:

```javascript
<span class="z-caroutext"
  data-texts='["awesome!", "really good.", "extremly beautiful.", "so badass!"]'
  data-timing="2000"
  data-pipe-color="#2a2">
</span>
```
